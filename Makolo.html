   <h1>When i went to kinshasa and came back to Venice</h1>
        <p>On the 16 december i took a brussels airlines OO-SFF to kinshasa i was supposed to takeoff at 12:20 but i got delayed and tookoff at 13.07</p>
</p>I came back to Venice (the 9 december) i took OO-SFB and did 8h and 16 minutes then i took a brand new a319 (OO-SSI) to venice.</p>

<p>When i was in OO-SFF i was always looking at the window non-stop for an hour and then i looked at a film before eating then i watched very bad trip on the airplane screen for the rest of the 5h. While i was watching films i was i actually had a game of planes that i was doing the same time and timing as what we did in the plane. For example i tookoff at the same time 13:07 and climed at the same altitude as the plane which was 35,000ft for the first 3 hour 37,000ft for 4h and went at 39,000ft for 30 before decending for 2 minutes and landing 1 minute later at 21:07 as we nwere late.</p>
