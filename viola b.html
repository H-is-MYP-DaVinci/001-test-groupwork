    <h3>In class, we are working with the CSS feature.</h3>
    <h2>I will show it to you thorught my website...</h2>
    <h3>Firstly, i will tell you a little bit about why i like this class...</h3>
    <p>A reason why i like this CS class is becasue we get to be creative while working, and write whatever goes through
        our minds in a website.
        I think its really interesting, but also mindblowing, how these codes can make websites from scratch.</p>
    <p>14/2/22. Today was a pretty good day. My friends (the boys) are very happy i'm a good friend to them.
        Oh, also my birthday is coming up. It's in about 14 days.</p>
    <h4>In my CS class, we are working on icons and styling them.
        It's not that hard, but nothing is easy, either. So, here are some icons.</h4>

    <p>I'm also having a problem with a friend.
        His name is Lorenzo and he is a really sweet boy.
        He's my age and he left the school this year. I have seen him once, before school started, in September.
        I would kile to see him again, but my friends started hating him and he started acting like an idiot, since i
        asked him to come to the movies wth me.
        He, the idiot that he is, asked if he could bring his NEW FRIENDS, which for me is kind of an insult.
        Occasionally, we talk on skype.</p>

    <p>In CS, we are also learning how to put liks in the website.
        here is a link to the New York Times.</p>
