    <h3>In class, we are working with the CSS feature.</h3>
        <h2>I will show it to you thorught my website...</h2>
        <h3>Firstly, i will tell you a little bit about why i like this class...</h3>
        <p>A reason why i like this CS class is becasue we get to be creative while working, and write whatever goes through our minds in a website.
            I think its really interesting, but also mindblowing, how these codes can make websites from scratch.</p>
